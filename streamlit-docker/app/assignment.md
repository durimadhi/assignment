                ###DESCRIPTION###

                In a global insights function at IKEA, many times as a data scientist you will be asked to sift through a variety of structured or unstructured datasets and more often than not starting with an abstract business question. The key to success in your role would not only be the structuring, modelling, translation and interpretation of that dataset, but also how you present those findings and subsequent insights back to the organization to help them achieve more clarity.
                An abstract question from a business stakeholder lands on your desk, “We have a few datasets for different global metropolitan areas and some other regional city databases comprised of various indicators. Would it be possible to cluster different cities globally and regionally together and tell us what patterns emerge in terms of commonalities across clusters of similar cities and segments over the new few years?”

                One of the potential starting points to approaching a random dataset would be to see how clusters emerge. Clustering is a statistical methodology/process that groups similar objects into clusters so that they can be grouped and therefore segmented. On the other hand, segmentation is the process of putting customers into groups based on their similarities. Clustering is from a statistical perspective while segmentation is from a business perspective. Clustering helps us find the relationship between data points so they can be segmented.

                Your job would be to try to approach this with any creative approach you would like to employ and present your findings to us playing the role of the abstract stakeholder.

                ###POINTS TO NOTE###

                The file may have multiple currency units(local, US$, US$ PPP or Purchasing Power Parity), real & nominal rates etc. Select and reduce wisely.

                Filter value type on “L”

                ###METHODOLOGY###

                Use an approach that performs the(cluster/segmentation) analysis and explain some of the choices you made in your journey from data to insights.

                ###INPUT###

                File:
                The file contains a few datasets of socio-demographic indicators for cities across the world. The CSV is comma delimited.
                The file contains the columns: 'country_id', 'country_name', 'area_id', 'area_name', 'indicator_id', 'indicator_name', 'value', 'value_unit', 'value_multiplier', 'value_type', 'year'.

                ###EXPECTED OUTPUT###

                1. Notebook/html file containing the code of your analysis
                2. Output of the segmentation(visualized)
                3. Insights/conclusion/recommendations based on the performed segmentation
                4. (BONUS) Productionized(machine learning) model(e.g. by using Flask or other technologies)
